# Changelog

- We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`. Be sure to include instructions on
  how applications should be upgraded.
- Include a link to your pull request.
- Don't include changes that are purely internal. The CHANGELOG should be a
  useful summary for people upgrading their application, not a replication
  of the commit log.
